# Nomad-Sitters
GA Project Two

Deployed Website: https://nomad-sitters.herokuapp.com/nomadsitters

Project Description:
A website for travelers. One of the biggest worries of traveling is leaving your home empty or your pets alone in a boarding facility. This website will allow users to create an account and post upcoming travel that they seek a house-sitter or pet-sitter for. Other users can then schedule their travel to accomodate those who need sitters. In exchange for house/pet-sitting, travelers will have free or inexpensive housing.
